# TreeLib

Treelib is a library of typescript made for Warcraft 3 the frozen throne.
It requires the map to be set to LUA as typescript compiles to lua.

Included is TSTL(Typescript to lua), and code definitions for the warcraft 3 API.

Uses npm to install dependencies and run everything.

This is not primarily a template for maps, even if it can be used that way but there is no real build instructions.
Generally you just change config.json to your desired values and run the entire thing with "npm run compileAndRunMap".
